### Poject Description
A totally pointless quest for emotional truth.This project’s sole purpose is to look at your face, guess your mood (probably wrong), and send you off to a webpage that might vaguely match your vibe.
### The Problem
In a world full of endless emojis, cryptic statuses, and confusing facial expressions, how can we ever know if someone is truly happy, mildly annoyed, or contemplating world domination? MoodScan is here to settle the mystery and save you from emotional guesswork!
### The Solution
Introducing MoodScan, the app you never knew you didn’t need! Why rely on emotional intelligence when you can let a machine decide if you're happy or mildly annoyed?.With just a simple scan of your face, MoodScan will present you with perfectly irrelevant web pages
